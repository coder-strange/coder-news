The secure enclave has its own CPU with its own secure boot chain and runs independently of the rest of the system. It runs a modified L4 microkernel and it does all of low-level key management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe secure enclave contains a unique ID burned into the hardware. This ID can be loaded as a key into the hardware AES engine, but is otherwise designed to be completely inaccessible. Assuming AES is secure, that means the key can be used to encrypt data but can\u0026#x27;t be extracted, not even by the supposedly secure software running in the secure enclave. This key is then used to generate other keys, like the ones used to encrypt files. That means you can\u0026#x27;t extract the flash memory, connect it to a computer, and then try to brute force it from there. Or rather you can, but you\u0026#x27;ll be brute forcing a 256-bit AES key, not a 4-digit PIN, making it effectively impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the secure enclave\u0026#x27;s tasks is taking a PIN (or fingerprint) and turning it into the encryption key needed to read the user\u0026#x27;s files. The main system just hands off the user\u0026#x27;s code to the secure enclave, and gets back either a key or a failure. The escalating delays with successive failures and wipe after too many failures are both done in the secure enclave. That means that updating the device\u0026#x27;s main OS won\u0026#x27;t affect it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of this is discussed in Apple\u0026#x27;s security guide here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.apple.com\u0026#x2F;business\u0026#x2F;docs\u0026#x2F;iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.apple.com\u0026#x2F;business\u0026#x2F;docs\u0026#x2F;iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe one open question is software updates for the secure enclave. According to that guide, its software can be updated. Does that mean it can be updated with code that removes the restrictions and allows brute-forcing passcodes? The guide doesn\u0026#x27;t address how the updates work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy guess, based on how meticulous Apple is about everything else, is that updates are designed to make this scenario impossible.

The rationale was that breaking the lock required quite a little time (and maybe even some door banging), increasing the chances that someone who tried to break in would be discovered, and physical evidence of a break-in was fairly hard to erase, as opposed to a purely electronic break-in which was quick to do (just enter the code).

That likely means the FBI needs federal legislation passed, which in the current climate will buy Apple considerable time. This is why they want to beat the order (though the feds could further appeal all the way to the.... wait for it.... 8 judge supreme court!) Though I think Scalia would have be on our side on this one). It\u0026#x27;s not about this particular case since there will be others, it\u0026#x27;s not about this particular order since there will eventually be legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) So why go ahead and do it anyways? Naive (but still valid) reason: they happen to be able to help and without it being ordered they can do it without handing over a tool for ad hoc decryption. They can even go to Hawaii after and throw the dev machines into a volcano to satisfy their inner hobbit (I highly recommend this part of the plan) to ensure that no one can abuse the power of the one ring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe non-naive answer is that for a quick project they get to show to the public that no, we the nerds are not so obsessed with abstract systems level thinking that we won\u0026#x27;t help when we can. It gets a lot harder for that moron Comey to hit the morning shows and throw shitty innuendo at the tech industry implying that we\u0026#x27;re aiding the terrorists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth encryption and terrorism are complicated subjects that are scary to the average American and although they distrust the government, they also distrust Silicon Valley. The cryptowars aren\u0026#x27;t about being right or they\u0026#x27;d have stayed dead in the 90s where they belong. Basically Apple makes tech look like the good guy fighting terrorism, and for anyone who cares (smaller audience than the fighting terrorism bit) they also defended your civil liberties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4) This trick only works on older devices. They will die out soon anyways. Newer devices are safe anyways. If they beat the order and do this one case voluntarily then no precedent is set, so they can\u0026#x27;t be bullied into doing it and old devices are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne device compromised, all other devices safe, order beat, PR win, Comey looks like a prick even to the uninformed next time he insinuates that we\u0026#x27;re the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e", "points": null, "parent_id": 11116840, "story_id": 11116274, "children": [{ "id": 11119433, "created_at": "2016-02-17T17:22:55.000Z", "created_at_i": 1455729775, "type": "comment", "author": "jonathankoren", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "\u003cp\u003eBut this all hinges on the naive assumptions that this is a one off and will never happen again, and that later generation devices are immune from any circumvention attempt.

Look at the prevalence of espionage tactics such as Stingrays and \u0026quot;parallel construction\u0026quot; by law enforcement. There may not always be someone you can pump up into an crack international terrorist, but there\u0026#x27;s always some low level drug courier, or a \u0026quot;quality of life\u0026quot; criminal to use your new toys on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso you\u0026#x27;re saying hat this doesn\u0026#x27;t set a precedent, but it does. Sure there\u0026#x27;s not a court case to point to, but it\u0026#x27;s a precedent none the less. It\u0026#x27;s that the company not only has the means, but the will to do it. What\u0026#x27;s stopping the government from coming back a second time, or a third time about this? What argument do you have on either a legal court or the court of public opinion to make when you stand up and say, \u0026quot;That first time was an exigent situation, and so was the second, and the third... But this time, the fourteenth time, THIS TIME we really mean no more!\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I don\u0026#x27;t think this trick only works on older devices. The FBI wants them to be able to brute force the passcode through a USB connection instead of making some sort of robot to tap the screen a bunch of times. Also presumably the FBI wants the the two many incorrect attempts lockout feature disabled as well, otherwise their just going to be waiting for hours on end. Why wouldn\u0026#x27;t this rather low sophistication approach work? from a technical stand point this is no more complicated than a mouse jiggler[0]. Of you\u0026#x27;re arguing that iPhone 6=\u0026lt; have some sort of \u0026quot;Mission: Impossible\u0026quot; self destruct mechanism, I\u0026#x27;m sure it could be disabled given enough resources and motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally (for real this time!), making a big stink and then capitulating is never a PR win.
